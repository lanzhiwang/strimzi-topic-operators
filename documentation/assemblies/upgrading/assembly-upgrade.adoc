= Upgrading {ProductName}

{ProductName} can be upgraded with no cluster downtime.
Each version of {ProductName} supports one or more versions of Apache Kafka.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of {ProductName}.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a lower supported Kafka version.

Newer versions of {ProductName} may support newer versions of Kafka, but you need to upgrade {ProductName} _before_ you can upgrade to a higher supported Kafka version.

IMPORTANT: If applicable, xref:assembly-upgrade-resources-{context}[Resource upgrades] _must_ be performed after upgrading {ProductName} and Kafka.
