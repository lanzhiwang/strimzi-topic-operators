= Deploying the Cluster Operator to watch a single namespace

This procedure shows how to deploy the Cluster Operator to watch {ProductName} resources in a single namespace in your Kubernetes cluster.

.Prerequisites

* This procedure requires use of a Kubernetes user account which is able to create `CustomResourceDefinitions`, `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`.
Use of Role Base Access Control (RBAC) in the Kubernetes cluster usually means that permission to create, edit, and delete these resources is limited to Kubernetes cluster administrators, such as `system:admin`.

.Procedure

. Edit the {ProductName} installation files to use the namespace the Cluster Operator is going to be installed to.
+
For example, in this procedure the Cluster Operator is installed to the namespace `_my-cluster-operator-namespace_`.
+

. Deploy the Cluster Operator:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
kubectl apply -f install/cluster-operator -n _my-cluster-operator-namespace_

. Verify that the Cluster Operator was successfully deployed:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
