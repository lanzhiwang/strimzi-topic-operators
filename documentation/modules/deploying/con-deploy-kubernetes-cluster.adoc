= Installing a local Kubernetes cluster

The easiest way to get started with Kubernetes is using Minikube.
This section provides basic guidance on how to use it.
For more information on the tools, refer to the documentation available online.

In order to interact with a Kubernetes cluster the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`]
utility needs to be installed.

You can download and install Minikube from the https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/[Kubernetes website].
Depending on the number of brokers you want to deploy inside the cluster, and if you need Kafka Connect running as well,
try running Minikube with at least with 4 GB of RAM instead of the default 2 GB.

Once installed, start Minikube using:

[source,shell]
minikube start --memory 4096
