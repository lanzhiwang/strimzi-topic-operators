= Distributed tracing

Within a Kafka deployment, distributed tracing using Jaeger is supported for:

* MirrorMaker to trace messages from a source cluster to a target cluster
* Kafka Connect to trace messages consumed and produced by Kafka Connect
* Kafka Bridge to trace messages consumed and produced by Kafka Bridge, and HTTP requests from client applications

Template configuration properties are set for the Kafka resources, which describe tracing environment variables.

== Tracing for Kafka clients
Client applications, such as Kafka producers and consumers, can also be set up so that transactions are monitored.
Clients are configured with a tracing profile, and a tracer is initialized for the client application to use.
